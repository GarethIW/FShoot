FShoot

Space InF#aders?

FShoot is my One Game a Month game for June. It is also the first time I have touched F#. Coming from C# and not fully understanding Functional programming, the code is written procedurally for the most part. I'd welcome any PRs that attempt to re-create parts of the engine with functional code!

Repositiory contains a VS2012 solution, which requires XNA GS4 to be installed, as per the instructions [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10881005/how-to-install-xna-game-studio-on-visual-studio-2012)



The _References folder contains the Monogame library to reference in the project.
 Alternatively, reference the XNA libs (Framework, Game, Graphics, Audio)
